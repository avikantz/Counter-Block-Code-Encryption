The more you see the less you knowThe less you find out as you goI knew much more then than I do nowNeon heart dayglo eyesA city lit by firefliesThey're advertising in the skiesFor people like usAnd I miss you when you're not aroundI'm getting ready to leave the ground...Ooh ooh oohOoh ooh oohOh you look so beautiful tonightIn the city of blinding lightsDon't look before you laughLook ugly in a photographFlash bulbs purple irisesThe camera can't seeI've seen you walk unafraidI've seen you in the clothes you madeCan you see the beauty inside of me?What happened to the beauty I had inside of meAnd I miss you when you're not aroundI'm getting ready to leave the groundOoh ooh oohOoh ooh oohOh you look so beautiful tonightIn the city of blinding lightsTime... timeWon't leave me as I amBut time won't take the boy out of this manOh you look so beautiful tonightOh you look so beautiful tonightOh you look so beautiful tonightIn the city of blinding lightsThe more you know the less you feelSome pray for others stealBlessings are not just for the ones who kneel... luckilyIs there a time for keeping your distanceA time to turn your eyes away?Is there a time for keeping your head downFor getting on with your day?Is there a time for kohl and lipstickA time for cutting hair?Is there a time for high street shoppingTo find the right dress to wear?Here she comes (Ooh-hoo)Heads turn aroundHere she comesTo take her crownIs there a time to run for coverA time for kiss and tell?Is there a time for different coloursDifferent names you find it hard to spell?Is there a time for first communionA time for East 17?Is there a time to turn to Mecca?Is there time to be a beauty queen?Here she comes (Ooh-hoo)Beauty plays the clownHere she comesSurreal in her crown''Dici che il fiumeTrova la via al mareE come il fiumeGiungerai a meOltre i confiniE le terre assetateDici che come fiumeCome fiumeL'amore giungerÃL'amoreE non so piÃ’ pregareE nell'amore non so piÃ’ sperareE quell'amore non so piÃ’ aspettare''Is there a time for tying ribbonsA time for Christmas trees?Is there a time for laying tables?And the night is set to freezeI wanna run, I want to hideI want to tear down the walls that hold me insideI want to reach out and touch the flameWhere the streets have no nameI want to feel sunlight on my faceI see the dust-cloud disappear without a traceI want to take shelter from the poison rainWhere the streets have no nameWhere the streets have no nameWhere the streets have no nameWe're still building and burning down loveBurning down loveAnd when I go thereI go there with youIt's all I can doThe city's a flood and our love turns to rustWe're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dustI'll show you a place high on a desert plainWhere the streets have no nameWhere the streets have no nameWhere the streets have no nameWe're still building and burning down loveBurning down loveAnd when I go thereI go there with youIt's all I can doOur love turns to rustWe're beaten and blown by the windSee our love turn to rustI'll be beaten and blown by the windAnd when I go thereI go there with youIt's all I can doMagnificentOh, oh, magnificentI was born, I was born to be with youIn this space and timeAfter that and ever afterI haven't had a clueOnly to break rhymeThis foolishness can leave a heart black and blue, oh, ohOnly love, only love can leave such a markBut only love, only love can heal such a scarI was born, I was born to sing for youI didn't have a choice but to lift you upAnd sing whatever song you wanted me toI give you back my voice from the wombMy first cry, it was a joyful noise, oh, ohOnly love, only love can leave such a markBut only love, only love can heal such a scarJustified till we die, you and I will magnify, oh, ohMagnificent, magnificent, ohOnly love, only love can leave such a markBut only love, only love unites our heartsJustified till we die, you and I will magnify, oh, ohMagnificent, magnificent, magnificentSee the stone set in your eyesSee the thorn twist in your sideI wait for youSleight of hand and twist of fateOn a bed of nails she makes me waitAnd I wait without youWith or without youWith or without youThrough the storm, we reach the shoreYou give it all but I want moreAnd I'm waiting for youWith or without youWith or without youI can't live with or without youAnd you give yourself awayAnd you give yourself awayAnd you give, and you giveAnd you give yourself awayMy hands are tied, my body bruisedShe's got me with nothing to winAnd nothing left to loseAnd you give yourself awayAnd you give yourself awayAnd you give, and you giveAnd you give yourself awayWith or without youWith or without youI can't liveWith or without youOh, oh, ohWith or without youWith or without you, ohI can't liveWith or without youWith or without youOohOohYou got a face not spoiled by beautyI have some scars from where I’ve beenYou’ve got eyes that can see right through meYou’re not afraid of anything you’ve seenI was told that I would feel nothing the first timeI don’t know how these cuts healBut in you I found a rhymeIf there is a lightYou can’t always seeAnd there is a worldWe can’t always beIf there is a darkThat we shouldn’t doubtAnd there is a lightDon’t let it go outAnd this is a songA song for someoneThis is a songA song for someoneYou let me into a conversationA conversation only we could makeYou break and enter my imaginationWhatever’s in thereIt’s yours to takeI was told I’d feel nothing the first timeYou were slow to healBut this could be the nightIf there is a lightYou can’t always seeAnd there is a worldWe can’t always beIf there is a darkWithin and withoutAnd there is a lightDon’t let it go outAnd this is a songA song for someoneThis is a songA song for someoneYeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYeah, yeah, yeah, yeahAnd I’m a long wayFrom your hill of CavalryAnd I’m a long wayFrom where I was and where I need to beIf there is a lightYou can’t always seeThere is a worldWe can’t always beIf there is a kissI stole from your mouthAnd there is a lightDon’t let it go outEvery breaking wave on the shoreTells the next one there'll be one moreAnd every gambler knows that to loseIs what you're really there forSummer I was fearlessNow I speak into an answer phoneLike every falling leaf on the breezeWinter wouldn't leave it aloneAloneIf you goIf you go your way and I go mineAre we soAre we so helpless against the tideBaby, every dog on the streetKnows that we’re in love with defeatAre we ready to be swept off our feetAnd stop chasing every breaking waveEvery sailor knows that the seaIs a friend made enemyAnd every shipwrecked soul knows what it isTo live without intimacyI thought I heard the captain’s voiceIt's hard to listen while you preachLike every broken wave on the shoreThis was as far as I can reachIf you goIf you go your way and I go mineAre we soAre we so helpless against the tideBaby, every dog on the streetKnows that we’re in love with defeatAre we ready to be swept off our feetAnd stop chasing every breaking waveThe waves know where are the rocksAnd drowning is no sinYou know where my heart isThe same place that yours has beenAnd we know the fear to winAnd so we end before we beginBefore we beginIf you goIf you go your way and I go mineAre we soAre we so helpless against the tideBaby, every dog on the streetKnows that we’re in love with defeatAre we ready to be swept off our feetAnd stop chasing every breaking waveIs it getting better?Or do you feel the same?Will it make it easier on you nowYou got someone to blameYou say one love, one lifeWhen it's one need in the nightOne love, we get to share itIt leaves you, baby, if you don't care for itDid I disappoint you?Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?You act like you never had loveAnd you want me to go withoutWell, it's too late tonightTo drag the past out into the lightWe're one, but we're not the sameWe get to carry each other, carry each otherOneHave you come here for forgiveness?Have you come to raise the dead?Have you come here to play JesusTo the lepers in your head?Did I ask too much, more than a lot?You gave me nothing, now it's all I gotWe're one, but we're not the sameWell, we hurt each other then we do it againYou sayLove is a temple, love, a higher lawLove is a temple, love, the higher lawYou ask me to enter, but then you make me crawlAnd I can't be holding on to what you gotWhen all you got is hurtOne love, one bloodOne life, you got to do what you shouldOne life with each otherSisters, brothersOne life, but we're not the sameWe get to carry each other, carry each otherOneOneOoh, ohMakin' it, makin' it, makin' itHigher, higher, higher, higherMorning, your toastYour tea and sugarRead about the politician’s loverGo through the dayLike a knife through butterWhy don’t youYou dress in the colours of forgivenessYour eyes as red as ChristmasPurple robes are folded on the kitchen chairYou’re gonna sleep like a baby tonightIn your dreams everything is alrightTomorrow dawns like someone else’s suicideYou’re gonna sleep like a baby tonightDreamsIt’s a dirty business, dreamingWhere there is silence and not screamingWhere there’s no daylightThere’s no healing, no noYou’re gonna sleep like a baby tonightIn your dreams everything is alrightTomorrow dawns like a suicideBut you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonightHope is where the door isWhen the church is where the war isWhere no one can feel no one else’s painYou’re gonna sleep like a baby tonightIn your dreams everything is alrightTomorrow dawns like a suicideBut you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonightSleep like a baby tonightLike a bird, your dreams take flightLike St. Francis covered in lightYou’re gonna sleep like a baby tonightFace down on a broken streetThere’s a man in the cornerIn a pool of miseryI’m in white vanAs a red sea covers the groundMetal crashI can’t tell what it isBut I take a lookAnd now I’m sorry I did5:30 on a Friday night33 good people cut downI don’t believe anymoreI don’t believe anymoreFace down on a pillow of shameThere are some girls with a needleTryin’ to spell my nameMy body’s not a canvasMy body’s now a toilet wallI don’t believe anymoreI don’t believe anymoreRaised by wolvesStronger than fearRaised by wolvesWe were raised by wolvesRaised by wolvesStronger than fearIf I open my eyesYou disappearRunning wildRunning wildRunning wildBoy sees his fatherCrushed under the weightOf a cross in a passionWhere the passion is hateRunning wildBlue mink FordI’m gonna detonate in your denRunning wildBlood in the houseBlood in the streetThe worst things in the worldAre justified by beliefRunning wildRegistration 1385-WZRunning wildI don’t believe anymoreRunning wildI don’t believe anymoreRaised by wolvesStronger than fearRaised by wolvesWe were raised by wolvesRaised by wolvesStronger than fearIf I open my eyesYou disappearRunning wildRunning wildRunning wildRunning wildRunning wild
